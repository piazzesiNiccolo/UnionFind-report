\begin{abstract}
The Union Find data structure, also called Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a very interesting data structure, not 
only  for the algorithmic techniques and  analysis involved, but also for its applications, especially to graph problems. In this
report I will present a high level view of UnionFind, describing the fundamental structure and the various implementations. In the last section, I will also present
a collection of problems for which the use of a DSU provides an efficient solution.

\section{Description}
Suppose we have a collection S of \emph{n} distinct elements, let's say the integers from 1 to \emph{n}. 

Initially these elements
are organized in n disjointed sets \{1\},\{2\},...,\{n\}. For simplicity we will assume that the name of set \{i\}
is i. In the union find problem we want to mantain a collection of disjointed sets while supporting the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{union}(A, B): join the sets A and B in a single set. The name of the new set is A and the old sets A and B are destroyed.
    \item \textbf{find}($x$): given an element $x$, return the name of the set that contains it.
\end{itemize}

    \begin{tikzpicture}
   
     \nodes{1,2,3,4,5,6}
     \node[minimum size=3mm] (start)[left=of n0] {\textbf{makeSet(1), ... , makeSet(6):}};
     \node[minimum size=3mm] (u1)[below=of start] {\textbf{Union(2,3):}};
     
    \end{tikzpicture}
    
    \caption{A circle}
    \label{fig:circle}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:circle} shows an example  with $n=6$. Let's generalize the problem by removing the assumption that we have n elements a priori.
Initially there are no elements and no sets, and the the new elements are introduced by the operation:\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{makeSet}($x$): Create a new set {x}. The name of the new set is $x$.
\end{itemize}
We will say that the UnionFind problem consists of mantaining a collection of disjointed sets during 
an arbitrary sequence of \emph{makeSet, union} and \emph{find} operations, starting from the empty set \cite{demetrescu}.
