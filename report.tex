\begin{abstract}
The Union Find data structure, also called Disjoint Set Union (DSU) is a very interesting data structure, not 
only  for the algorithmic techniques and  analysis involved, but also for its applications, especially to graph problems. In this
report I will present a high level view of UnionFind, describing the fundamental structure and the various implementations. In the last section, I will also present
a collection of problems for which the use of a DSU provides an efficient solution.
\end{abstract}
\section{Description}
Suppose we have a collection S of \emph{n} distinct elements, let's say the integers from 1 to \emph{n}. 

Initially these elements
are organized in n disjointed sets \{1\},\{2\},...,\{n\}. For simplicity we will assume that the name of set \{i\}
is i. In the union find problem we want to mantain a collection of disjointed sets while supporting the following operations:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{union}(A, B): join the sets A and B in a single set $A \cup B$. The old sets A and B are destroyed.
    \item \textbf{find}($x$): given an element $x$, return the name of the set that contains it.
\end{itemize}
Let's now generalize the problem. We have assumed before that the n elements are already given. This is not true in general, so we need a way to 
add new elements (and consequentially new sets). This is solved by introducing a third operation:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{makeSet}($x$): Create a new set {$x$} containing the single element $x$.
\end{itemize}
    We will say that the UnionFind problem consists of mantaining a collection of disjointed sets during 
an arbitrary sequence of \emph{makeSet, union} and \emph{find} operations, starting from the empty set \cite{demetrescu}. Figure \ref{fig:circle} shows a
simple example where the elements considered are numbers. For the rest of the report we will consider a unionFind problem with
$n$ makeSet operations and $m$ find operations. Since we have a total of n disjointed sets, we don't have to specify the number
of union operations, because they cannot be more than $n-1$.

\section{Naive Implementations}
The general idea for implementing UnionFind is to consider the collection as a forest of trees, with each tree representing a single set. 
In the following code we will only consider integers as elements and use an array representation of the forest.
Given an array \emph{parents} the element \emph{parents[i]} contains the direct parent of element \emph{i} in the tree hierarchy. For the root
r of a tree we will have parents[r] $=$ r. Before analyzing a more efficient implementation, we will see two simpler versions.
\newpage
\subsection{QuickFind} \label{QF}
QuickFind aims at having a very good time complexity for the find operation. To achieve this, it represent each set as a tree of height 1. Each element
has a pointer to the root of the tree,  and the root contains the name of the set. The find operation simply follows the pointer and returns the name of the
set. It's easy to see that it has $O(1)$ time complexity. MakeSet(e) creates a new tree composed by two nodes: the root and a single leaf child. It stores e both in the root and
in the leaf. MakeSet is $O(1)$ as well. The union operation deletes the pointer from the elements to the root of the old tree
and add new pointers to the root of the new tree. In the worst case, this takes $O(n)$. Figure \ref{fig:quickFind} gives a visualization of this operation. Space complexity is $(O(n)$.

\label{fig:quickFind}
\end{figure}
Listing \ref{lab:qf} shows a possible implementation in $C++$. As i said before,
we use an array representation so each pointer becomes simply an element of the array.
If for example we want to compute find(3) we return the element parents$[3]$;
\begin{center}
    \lstinputlisting[language=C++,caption=Quickfind implementation,label=lab:qf]{code/quickFind.cpp} 
\end{center}

\subsection{QuickUnion} \label{QU}
In QuickUnion we also use trees, but they can have height $\neq$ 1. Each element has a pointer to their
direct parent in the tree. MakeSet is identical to the QuickFind implementation. Union(A,B) makes the root of B a child of the 
root of A, by simply adding a pointer. The find operation is slightly more complez. Let's say
we want to compute find(\emph{e}) for a generic \emph{e}. Starting from \emph{e} we repeatedly 
follow the pointer to the father until we find the root of the tree.
\begin{figure}[h!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]  {img/uf.jpg}
    \caption{makeSet(x), union(A,B) and find(x) = y in QuickUnion}
    \label{fig:quickUnion}
\end{figure}
\newpage
The time complexity of find grows linearly with the height of the tree. It's easy to see
that, if we start with $n$ disjointed sets the worst case is having a tree of height $n$. A sequence
of $n-1$ union operations that could lead to this case is the following: union(1,2), union(2,3),..., union(n-1,n).
In this situation, find has $O(n)$ time complexity. 
\begin{center}
    \lstinputlisting[language=C++,caption=QuickUnion implementation,label=lab:qu]{code/quickUnion.cpp} 
\end{center}
Let's discuss the cost of union. As previously said,
this consists in creating a new pointer from the root of the old tree to the root of the new tree. This can be done 
very easily in $O(1)$ time. If we look to the implementation in Listing \ref{lab:qu} we notice
that in the union operation we first call find to find the root of the trees containing the elements. Find takes $O(n)$ and this dominates the 
total complexity, so the union method in that code takes $ O(n)$ as well. But this is just one possible implementation, and we analyze
the abstract operation, so our previous analysis is still valid. 

\section{Balancing Heuristics}
Now we will see some heuristics that aim to improve the time complexity of the operations descibed. In particular
we will first see aan heuristic to improve union in the quickFind algorithm and then various heuristics to improve
find in the QuickUnion algorithm. Note that in this section we will simply describe the techniques while the 
complexity analysis will be shown in the next part.
\subsection{Balancing union in QuickFind}
To improve the performance of QuickFind we must focus on the most expensive operation, which we know is 
union. We can observe that the implementation that we described in section \ref{QF} is not very smart. The more $ | B | $ the more
Union(A, B) costs. When we have $|A| < |B| $ it is more efficient to move the nodes of the set A. The new set
$A \cup B$ will still be named A.

    \end{tikzpicture}
    \caption{Union(A,B) when $|A| < |B|$}
    \label{fig:qfsize}
\end{figure}
In the implementation, we store an auxiliary array \emph{size} which keeps track
of the cardinality of each set.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=updated operations in QuickFind, label=lab:qfu]
    QuickFind(int n) : n(n)
    {
        parents.resize(n);
        std::iota(parents.begin(), parents.end(), 0);
        std::vector<int> size(n, 1);
    }

    void makeSet(int x)
    {
        if (x >= parents.size())
            parents.resize(x);
        parents.at(x) = x;
        size.at(x) = 1;
    }
    void set_union(int a, int b)
    {
        if (a != b)
        {
            if(size[a] < size[b]) std::swap(a,b);
            for (auto i : parents)
            {
                if (i == b)
                    i = a;
            }
            size[a] += size[b];
        }
    }
    
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Balancing heuristics for QuickUnion}
To improve the QuickUnion algorithm, we need to make \emph{find} more efficient.
In section \ref{QU} we observed that this operation has a worst-case $O(n)$ time complexity.
This is due to the fact that we allow the height of the trees to grow without any control when 
doing a \emph{union}. 
\paragraph{Union by Size}
The first heuristic uses the same idea of the QuickFind union heuristic. When doing \emph{Union(A,B)}
we make the smaller set in size child of the bigger set.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=Union by size implementation, label=quu]
    void set_union(int a, int b)
    {
        a = find(a);
        b = find(b);
        if (a != b) {
            if (size[a] < size[b])
                std::swap(a, b);
            parents[b] = a;
            size[a] += size[b];
        }
    }

\end{lstlisting}
\paragraph{Union By Rank} In union by rank we use the depth of the tree instead
of its size. The approach is the same of Union By size: we attach the shorter tree
to the taller one.
\begin{lstlisting}[caption=QuickUnion using Union by Rank]
    QuickUnion(int n) : n(n)
    {
        parents.resize(n);
        std::iota(parents.begin(), parents.end(), 0);
        ranks.resize(n);
    }

    void makeSet(int x)
    {
        if (x >= parents.size())
            parents.resize(x);
        parents.at(x) = x;
        ranks.at(x) = 0;
    }
    void set_union(int a, int b)
    {
        a = find(a);
        b = find(b);
        if (a != b)
        {
            if (ranks[a] < ranks[b])
                std::swap(a, b);
            parents[b] = a;
            if (ranks[a] == ranks[b])
                ranks[a]++;
        }
    }
\end{lstlisting}
